# Changelog

## 1.3.1

### Maintenance
* Add timestamping to signed jars. [PR #85](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/85)
* Create the `Janitor` in the `Loader` so that it gets a more logical and consistent `ThreadGroup`. [PR #87](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/87)
* Signed with new JCE signing certificate

## 1.3.0

### Improvements
* Now supports ECDSA signatures in IEEE P1363 Format. (Also known as "raw" or "plain".) [PR #75](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/75)
* Now allows cloning of `Mac` objects. [PR #78](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/78)

### Maintenance
* You can disable parallel execution of tests by setting the `ACCP_TEST_PARALLEL` environment variable to `false` 

## 1.2.0

### Improvements
* Now uses [OpenSSL 1.1.1.d](https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1d.tar.gz). [PR #60](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/60)

### Patches
* Detects stuck AMD Ryzen RDRAND and correctly treats as an error [PR #67](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/67)
* When initialized with an `int`,`KeyPairGenerator` for "EC" keys now always uses "secp*r1" curves.
  This matches the behavior of SunEC.
  **This changes the curves selected for 192 from secp192k1 to secp192r1/P-192, and curves selected for 256 from secp256k1 to secp256r1/P-256.**
  [PR #68](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/68)

### Maintenance
* The test output now contains a prefix indication whether the suite will fail. [PR #63](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/63)
* You can disable colored test output by setting the `ACCP_TEST_COLOR` environment variable to `false` [PR #64](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/64)

## 1.1.1

### Patches
* `amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security` updated to work on both JDK8 and JDK9+ [PR #49](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/49)
* Improved performance of single-byte handling in message digests. [PR #53](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/53) and [PR #54](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/pull/54)
