/**
 * This class implements an alternative to traditional finalizers, which allows finalizable references to be cancelled
 * if cleanup happens synchronously.
 * <br/>
 * Typical usage will create one long-lived Janitor which will serve for the lifetime of the process, and clean up any
 * Messes which aren't explicitly cleaned before being unreferenced.
 * <br/>
 * In specialized use cases, the Janitor instance itself can be unreferenced; the background cleanup thread will then
 * terminate when all associated Messes are cleaned (and the GC notices the loss of the Janitor reference).
 * <br/>
 * The function of this class is similar to Java 9's {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner}, but it avoids a single lock on the
 * data structure responsible for keeping the phantom references alive (and is compatible with Java 8).
