# Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider
The Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider (ACCP) is a collection of high-performance cryptographic implementations exposed via the standard [JCA/JCE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-cryptography-architecture-jca-reference-guide.html) interfaces.
This means that it can be used as a drop in replacement for many different Java applications.
(Differences from the default OpenJDK implementations are [documented here](./DIFFERENCES.md).)
As of 2.0.0, algorithms exposed by ACCP are primarily backed by [AWS-LC](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc)'s implementations.

# Notes on ACCP-FIPS
ACCP-FIPS is a variation of ACCP which uses AWS-LC-FIPS 2.x as its cryptographic module. This version of AWS-LC-FIPS has completed FIPS validation testing by an accredited lab and has been submitted to NIST for certification. Refer to the [NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program's Modules In Progress List](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List) for the latest status of the AWS-LC Cryptographic Module. We will also update our release notes and documentation to reflect any changes in FIPS certification status. We provide ACCP-FIPS for experimentation and performance testing in the interim.

Version 2.3.0 is the first release of ACCP-FIPS. The Maven coordinates for
ACCP-FIPS are the same as ACCP with one difference that ACCP-FIPS's
artifact ID is `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider-FIPS`.

Notable differences between ACCP and ACCP-FIPS:
* ACCP uses [the latest release of AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/releases), whereas, ACCP-FIPS uses [the fips-2022-11-02 branch of AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/tree/fips-2022-11-02).
* ACCP-FIPS builds AWS-LC in FIPS mode by passing `-DFIPS=1` when configuring AWS-LC's build.
* In FIPS-mode, RSA keys are limited to 2048, 3072, or 4096 bits in size with public exponent F4.
* ACCP-FIPS does not register SecureRandom by default due to the performance of AWS-LCâ€™s entropy source in FIPS-mode. [A system property](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider#other-system-properties) is available to register SecureRandom from AWS-LC if needed, and the performance differences are described in further detail under the description of that property.
* Due to the fact that an older branch of AWS-LC is used in FIPS-mode, there will be performance differences between ACCP and ACCP-FIPS. We highly recommend performing detailed performance testing of your application if you choose to experiment with ACCP-FIPS.

ACCP-FIPS is only supported on the following platforms:

| Platfrom | FIPS support since version |
|----------|----------------------------|
| `linux-x86_64` | 2.3.0 |
| `linux-aarch_64` | 2.3.0 |

# Compatibility & Requirements
ACCP has the following requirements:
* JDK8 or newer (This includes both OracleJDK and [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/))
* Linux (x86-64 or arm64) or MacOs running on x86_64 (also known as x64 or AMD64)

ACCP comes bundled with AWS-lC's `libcrypto.so`, so it is not neccessery to install AWS-LC on the host or container where you run your application.

If ACCP is used/installed on a system it does not support, it will disable itself and the JVM will behave as if ACCP weren't installed at all.

# Using the provider
## Installation
Installing via Maven or Gradle is the easiest way to get ACCP and ensure you
will always have the most recent version. We strongly recommend you always pull
in the latest version for best performance and bug-fixes.

Whether you're using Maven, Gradle, or some other build system that also pulls
packages from Maven Central, it's important to specify a classifier, otherwise,
one would get an empty package. The possible classifiers are as follows:

| Classifier | Support since version | FIPS support since version |
|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| `linux-x86_64` | 1.0.0 | 2.3.0 |
| `linux-aarch_64` | 2.0.0 | 2.3.0 |
| `osx-x86_64` | 2.3.2 | Not supported |
| `osx-aarch_64` | 2.3.3 | Not supported |


Regardless of how you acquire ACCP (Maven, manual build, etc.) you will still need to follow the guidance in the [Configuration section](#configuration) to enable ACCP in your application.

### Maven
Add the following to your `pom.xml` or wherever you configure your Maven dependencies.
This will instruct it to use the latest `2.x` version of ACCP for Linux x86-64 platform.
For more information, please see [VERSIONING.rst](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/blob/main/VERSIONING.rst).

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.cryptools</groupId>
  <artifactId>AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider</artifactId>
  <version>[2.0, 3.0)</version>
  <classifier>linux-x86_64</classifier>
</dependency>
```

The artifactId for FIPS builds is `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider-FIPS`.

ACCP artifacts on Maven can be verified using the following PGP keys:

| ACCP Version  | PGP Key ID       | Key Server |
|---------------|------------------|------------|
| 1.x | 6F189046CEE0B2C1 | keyserver.ubuntu.com |
| 2.x | 5EFEEFE6BD0BD916 | keyserver.ubuntu.com |


### Gradle
Add the following to your `build.gradle` file. If you already have a
`dependencies` block in your `build.gradle`, you can add the ACCP line to your
existing block.
For more information, please see [VERSIONING.rst](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/blob/main/VERSIONING.rst).

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'software.amazon.cryptools:AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider:2.+:linux-x86_64'
}
```

For Gradle builds, the [os-detector plugin](https://github.com/google/osdetector-gradle-plugin)
could be used so that one does not have to explicitly specify the platform.
[Here](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/blob/f1d54b34cf4765789314941dbeefdafd35a4da58/examples/gradle-kt-dsl/lib/build.gradle.kts#L30)
is an example.

### Bundle ACCP with JDK
We provide two scripts that allow one to add ACCP to their JDKs: one for JDK8 and one for JDKs 11+.
Please note that these scripts are provided as examples and for testing only.

These scripts take the version of ACCP and the classifier as input. Optionally, one can pass `-FIPS`
as the third argument to bundle the FIPS artifacts. To use these scripts, please set `JAVA_HOME` to
the path of your desired JDK.

Usage example:
```bash
./bin/bundle-accp.sh 2.3.3 linux-x86_64
```

To find the the available versions and classifiers, please checkout Maven central.

Some notes on the bundling scripts:
* One needs to run the bundling script only once.
* The bundling is not idempotent: runing the script on a JDK that has ACCP bundled in it could result in undefined behavior.
* There is no unbundling. Please do a fresh install of the JDK if you need to remove ACCP from your JDK.

### Manual
Manual installation requires acquiring the provider and adding it to your classpath.
You can either download a prebuilt version of the provider or build it yourself.
Adding a jar to your classpath is highly application and build-system dependant and we cannot provide specific guidance.

#### Download from GitHub releases
The most recent version of our provider will always be on our official [releases](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/releases) page.

#### Build it yourself
*Please be aware that if you build the provider yourself then it will NOT work with OracleJDK.
The OracleJDK requires that JCA providers be cryptographically signed by a trusted certificate.
The JARs we publish via Maven and our official [releases](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/releases) are signed by our private key,
but yours will not be.*

Building this provider requires a 64 bit Linux or MacOS build system with the following prerequisites installed:
* OpenJDK 10 or newer
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) 3.8 or newer
* C++ build chain
* [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) for coverage metrics
* [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/) for reporting coverage metrics in CodeBuild

1. Download the repository via `git clone --recurse-submodules`
2. Run `./gradlew release`
3. The resulting jar is in `build/lib`

#### Repackaging ACCP into Uber/Fat Jars
Please be aware that repackaging ACCP's published Jar files from Maven into your own "uber" or "fat" JAR file may not 
work on OracleJDK. The OracleJDK requires that JCE providers be cryptographically signed by a trusted certificate. The 
JARs we publish via Maven and our official [releases](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/releases) are signed by our private key, but yours will not be.

Depending on how ACCP is repackaged, ACCP's existing signature may be invalidated, and you may receive one of the
following exceptions: 
 - `java.util.jar.JarException: The JCE Provider file is not signed.`
 - `java.lang.SecurityException: JCE cannot authenticate the provider`
 - `java.security.NoSuchProviderException: JCE cannot authenticate the provider`

If you receive one of these exceptions, then you will need to evaluate if any of the following options will work for your application and environment:
1. Exclude ACCP from your repackaging process, keeping ACCP's jar file unmodified, and deploying both your uber jar and ACCP jar as separate jar files.
2. Use a non-standard Java ClassLoader that allows loading a "jar of jars" (such as [Spring-boot's NestedJarFile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html#appendix.executable-jar.jarfile-class)), and copy ACCP's Jar file into the parent Jar file so that ACCP's JCE signature remains intact.
3. Migrate to a different JDK (eg OpenJDK or CorrettoJDK) that does not require that JCE providers be signed.
4. [Obtain your own JCE Code Signing Certificate](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/getcodesigningcertificate.html) and sign your repackaged Jar.

##### FIPS builds
**FIPS builds are still experimental and are not yet ready for production use.**

By providing `-DFIPS=true` to `gradlew` you will cause the entire build to be for a "FIPS mode" build.
The FIPS builds use a different version of AWS-LC along with `FIPS=1` build flag. Not all releases of
AWS-LC will have FIPS certification. As a result, ACCP in FIPS mode only uses a version of AWS-LC
that has FIPS certification or it will have in future.

For performance reasons, ACCP does not register a SecureRandom implementation in FIPS mode.
Relevant operations within the FIPS module boundary (e.g. key generation, non-deterministic signing, etc.) will still use AWS-LC's internal DRBG.
Users who require ACCP to provide FIPS-validated pseudo-randomness _outside_ the module boundary via SecureRandom should set `registerSecureRandom=true`.

When changing between FIPS and non-FIPS builds, be sure to do a full `clean` of your build environment.

##### All targets
* clean: Remove all artifacts except AWS-LC build artifacts
* deep_clean: Remove the entire `build/` directory including build artifacts from AWS-LC dependencies
* build: Build the library
* test: Run unit tests
* test_extra_checks: Run unit tests with extra (slow) cryptographic checks enabled
* test_integration: Run integration tests
* test_integration_extra_checks: Run integration tests with extra (slow) cryptographic checks enabled
* coverage: Run target `test` and collect both Java and C++ coverage metrics (saved in `build/reports`)
* release: **Default target** depends on build, test, and coverage
* overkill: Run **all** tests (no coverage)
* generateEclipseClasspath: Generates a `.classpath` file which is understandable by Eclipse and VS Code to make development easier. (This should ideally be run prior to opening ACCP in your IDE.)
* single_test: Runs a single unit test. The test is selected with the Java system property `SINGLE_TEST`. For example: `./gradlew single_test -DSINGLE_TEST=com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.test.EcGenTest`
  (You may need to do a clean build when switching between selected tests.)

## Configuration
There are several ways to configure the ACCP as the highest priority provider in Java.

### Code
Run the following method early in program start up: `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.install()`

### Via Security Properties
Add the following Java property to your programs command line: `-Djava.security.properties=/path/to/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security` where amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security is downloaded from
[amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security) (for JDK versions older than JDK15)
or [amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security) (for JDK15 or newer)
in our repository.

### Modify the JVM settings
Modify the `java.security` file provided by your JVM so that the highest priority provider is the Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider.
Look at [amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security) (JDKs 11 and older)
or [amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security) (for JDKs newer than 11)
for an example of what this change will look like.

### Verification (Optional)
If you want to check to verify that ACCP is properly working on your system, you can do any of the following:
1. Verify that the highest priority provider actually is ACCP:
```java
if (Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding").getProvider().getName().equals(AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.PROVIDER_NAME)) {
    // Successfully installed
}
```
2. Ask ACCP about its health
```java
if (AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.INSTANCE.getLoadingError() == null && AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.INSTANCE.runSelfTests().equals(SelfTestStatus.PASSED)) {
    // Successfully installed
}
```
3. Assert that ACCP is healthy and throw a `RuntimeCryptoException` if it isn't.
We generally do not recommend this solution as we believe that gracefully falling back to other providers is usually the better option.
```java
AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.INSTANCE.assertHealthy();
```

### Other system properties
ACCP can be configured via several system properties.
None of these should be needed for standard deployments, and we recommend not touching them.
They are of most use to developers needing to test ACCP or experiment with benchmarking.
These are all read early in the load process and may be cached so any changes to them made from within Java may not be respected.
Thus, these should all be set on the JVM command line using `-D`.

* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.extrachecks`
   Adds exta cryptographic consistency checks which are not necessary on standard systems.
   These checks may be computationally expensive and are not normally relevant.
   See `ExtraCheck.java` for values and more information.
   (Also accepts "ALL" as a value to enable all flags and "help" to print out all flags to STDERR.)
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.debug`
   Enables extra debugging behavior.
   These behaviors may be computationally expensive, produce additional output, or otherwise change the behavior of ACCP.
   No values here will lower the security of ACCP or cause it to give incorrect results.
   See `DebugFlag.java` for values and more information.
   (Also accepts "ALL" as a value to enable all flags and "help" to print out all flags to STDERR.)
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.useExternalLib`
   Takes in `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`).
   If `true` then ACCP skips trying to load the native library bundled within its JAR and goes directly to the system library path.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.janitor.stripes`
   Takes *positive integer value* which is the requested minimum number of "stripes" used by the `Janitor` for dividing cleaning tasks (messes) among its workers.
   (Current behavior is to default this value to 4 times the CPU core count and then round the value up to the nearest power of two.)
   See `Janitor.java` for for more information.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.cacheselftestresults` Takes in `true` or `false`
  (defaults to `true`). If set to `true`, the results of running tests are cached,
  and the subsequent calls to `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider::runSelfTests`
  would avoid re-running tests; otherwise, each call to `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider::runSelfTests`
  re-run the tests.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.registerEcParams`
  Takes in `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`).
  If `true`, then ACCP will register its EC-flavoered AlgorithmParameters implementation on startup.
  Else, the JCA will get the implementation from another registered provider (usually stock JCE).
  Using JCE's impelmentation is generally recommended unless using ACCP as a standalone provider
  Callers can choose to register ACCP's implementation at runtime with a call to `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.registerEcParams()`
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.registerSecureRandom`
  Takes in `true` or `false` (defaults to `false` in FIPS mode, defaults to `true` in non-FIPS).
  If `true`, then ACCP will register a SecureRandom implementation (`LibCryptoRng`) backed by AWS-LC
  Else, ACCP will not register a SecureRandom implementation, meaning that the JCA will source SecureRandom instances from another registered provider. AWS-LC will still use its internal DRBG for key generation and other operations requiring secure pseudo-randomness.
  LibCryptoRng is very fast during steady state operation in all cases. In FIPS mode, however, AWS-LC-FIPS's CPU jitter-based entropy source incurs a ~10ms initialization cost for every new thread.
  This means that there is a slight "pause" before ACCP FIPS's SecureRandom can produce pseudo-random bytes in highly threaded environments.
  Because, in extreme cases this could present an availability risk, we do not register LibCryptoRng by default in configurations where this initialization cost is incurred (i.e. FIPS mode).
  Non-FIPS AWS-LC does not use CPU jitter for its DRBG seed's entropy, and therefore does not incur this initialization cost, therefore we register LibCryptoRng by default when not in FIPS mode.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.nativeContextReleaseStrategy`
  Takes in `HYBRID`, `LAZY`, or `EAGER` (defaults ot `HYBRID`). This property only affects
  AES-GCM cipher for now. AES-GCM associates a native object of type `EVP_CIPHER_CTX`
  to each `Cipher` object. This property allows users to control the strategy for releasing
  the native object.
  * `HYBRID` (default): the structure is released eagerly, unless the same AES key is used. This is the
     default behavior, and it is consistent with prior releases of ACCP.
  * `LAZY`: preserve the native object and do not release while the `Cipher` object is not garbage collected.
  * `EAGER`: release the native object as soon as possible, regardless of using the same key or not.
  Our recommendation is to set this property to `EAGER` if `Cipher` objects are discarded
  after use and caching of `Cipher` objects is not needed. When reusing the same `Cipher`
  object, it would be beneficial to set this system property to `LAZY` so that different
  encryption/decryption operations would not require allocation and release of `EVP_CIPHER_CTX`
  structure. A common use case would be having long-running threads that each would get its
  own instance of `Cipher` class.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.tmpdir`
   Allows one to set the temporary directory used by ACCP when loading native libraries.
   If this system property is not defined, the system property `java.io.tmpdir` is used.
