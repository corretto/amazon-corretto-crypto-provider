# Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider
The Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider (ACCP) is a collection of high-performance cryptographic implementations exposed via the standard [JCA/JCE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-cryptography-architecture-jca-reference-guide.html) interfaces.
This means that it can be used as a drop in replacement for many different Java applications.
(Differences from the default OpenJDK implementations are [documented here](./DIFFERENCES.md).)
As of 2.0.0, algorithms exposed by ACCP are primarily backed by [AWS-LC](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc)'s implementations.

## Build Status
Please be aware that both "Overkill" and "Dieharder" tests are known to be flakey.
Both of these tests are flakey because they include entropy generation tests
(specificaly, the [Dieharder tests](http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php)).
Entropy tests are unavoidably flakey because there is always a possibility that a high-quality
random number generator will output data which looks non-random.
(For example, even a fair coin will come up heads ten times in a row about one in a thousand trials.)

# Compatibility & Requirements
ACCP has the following requirements:
* JDK8 or newer (This includes both OracleJDK and [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/))
* Linux (x86-64 or arm64) or MacOs running on x86_64 (also known as x64 or AMD64)

ACCP comes bundled with AWS-lC's `libcrypto.so`, so it is not neccessery to install AWS-LC on the host or container where you run your application.

If ACCP is used/installed on a system it does not support, it will disable itself and the JVM will behave as if ACCP weren't installed at all.

# Using the provider
## Installation
Installing via Maven or Gradle is the easiest way to get ACCP and ensure you
will always have the most recent version. We strongly recommend you always pull
in the latest version for best performance and bug-fixes.

Whether you're using Maven, Gradle, or some other build system that also pulls
packages from Maven Central, it's important to specify `linux-x86_64` or `linux-aarch64` as the
classifier. You'll get an empty package otherwise. Note that ACCP is not
available for MacOS on Maven Central yet.

Regardless of how you acquire ACCP (Maven, manual build, etc.) you will still need to follow the guidance in the [Configuration section](#configuration) to enable ACCP in your application.

### Maven
Add the following to your `pom.xml` or wherever you configure your Maven dependencies.
This will instruct it to use the latest `2.x` version of ACCP for Linux x86-64 platform.
For more information, please see [VERSIONING.rst](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/blob/main/VERSIONING.rst).

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.cryptools</groupId>
  <artifactId>AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider</artifactId>
  <version>[2.0, 3.0)</version>
  <classifier>linux-x86_64</classifier>
</dependency>
```

The classifier attribute could be set to `linux-aarch64` to use ACCP on Linux ARM64 platforms.

ACCP artifacts on Maven can be verified using the following PGP keys:

| ACCP Version  | PGP Key ID       | Key Server |
|---------------|------------------|------------|
| 1.x | 6F189046CEE0B2C1 | keyserver.ubuntu.com |
| 2.x | 5EFEEFE6BD0BD916 | keyserver.ubuntu.com |


### Gradle
Add the following to your `build.gradle` file. If you already have a
`dependencies` block in your `build.gradle`, you can add the ACCP line to your
existing block.
For more information, please see [VERSIONING.rst](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/blob/main/VERSIONING.rst).

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'software.amazon.cryptools:AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider:2.+:linux-x86_64'
}
```

For Gradle builds, the [os-detector plugin](https://github.com/google/osdetector-gradle-plugin)
could be used so that one does not have to explicitly specify the platform.
[Here](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/blob/f1d54b34cf4765789314941dbeefdafd35a4da58/examples/gradle-kt-dsl/lib/build.gradle.kts#L30)
is an example.

### Manual
Manual installation requires acquiring the provider and adding it to your classpath.
You can either download a prebuilt version of the provider or build it yourself.
Adding a jar to your classpath is highly application and build-system dependant and we cannot provide specific guidance.

#### Download from GitHub releases
The most recent version of our provider will always be on our official [releases](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/releases) page.

#### Build it yourself
*Please be aware that if you build the provider yourself then it will NOT work with OracleJDK.
The OracleJDK requires that JCA providers be cryptographically signed by a trusted certificate.
The JARs we publish via Maven and our official [releases](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/releases) are signed by our private key,
but yours will not be.*

Building this provider requires a 64 bit Linux or MacOS build system with the following prerequisites installed:
* OpenJDK 10 or newer
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) 3.8 or newer
* C++ build chain
* [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) for coverage metrics
* [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/) for reporting coverage metrics in CodeBuild
* [dieharder](http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php) for entropy tests

1. Download the repository via `git clone --recurse-submodules`
2. Run `./gradlew release`
3. The resulting jar is in `build/lib`

##### FIPS builds
**FIPS builds are still experimental and are not yet ready for production use.**

By providing `-DFIPS=true` to `gradlew` you will cause the entire build to be for a "FIPS mode" build.
The only significant difference is that AWS-LC is built with `FIPS=1`.

For performance reasons, ACCP does not register a SecureRandom implementation in FIPS mode.
Relevant operations within the FIPS module boundary (e.g. key generation, non-deterministic signing, etc.) will still use AWS-LC's internal DRBG.
Users who require ACCP to provide FIPS-validated pseudo-randomness _outside_ the module boundary via SecureRandom should set `registerSecureRandom=true`.

When changing between FIPS and non-FIPS builds, be sure to do a full `clean` of your build environment.

##### All targets
* clean: Remove all artifacts except AWS-LC build artifacts
* deep_clean: Remove the entire `build/` directory including build artifacts from AWS-LC dependencies
* build: Build the library
* test: Run unit tests
* test_extra_checks: Run unit tests with extra (slow) cryptographic checks enabled
* test_integration: Run integration tests
* test_integration_extra_checks: Run integration tests with extra (slow) cryptographic checks enabled
* dieharder: Run entropy tests
* dieharder_threads: Run entropy threads specifically checking for leaking state across threads (very slow)
* dieharder_all: Run all dieharder checks (both dieharder and dieharder_threads)
* coverage: Run target `test` and collect both Java and C++ coverage metrics (saved in `build/reports`)
* release: **Default target** depends on build, test, and coverage
* overkill: Run **all** tests (no coverage)
* generateEclipseClasspath: Generates a `.classpath` file which is understandable by Eclipse and VS Code to make development easier. (This should ideally be run prior to opening ACCP in your IDE.)
* single_test: Runs a single unit test. The test is selected with the Java system property `SINGLE_TEST`. For example: `./gradlew single_test -DSINGLE_TEST=com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.test.EcGenTest`
  (You may need to do a clean build when switching between selected tests.)

## Configuration
There are several ways to configure the ACCP as the highest priority provider in Java.

### Code
Run the following method early in program start up: `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.install()`

### Via Security Properties
Add the following Java property to your programs command line: `-Djava.security.properties=/path/to/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security` where amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security is downloaded from
[amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security) (for JDK versions older than JDK15)
or [amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security) (for JDK15 or newer)
in our repository.

### Modify the JVM settings
Modify the `java.security` file provided by your JVM so that the highest priority provider is the Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider.
Look at [amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider.security) (JDKs 11 and older)
or [amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security](./etc/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-jdk15.security) (for JDKs newer than 11)
for an example of what this change will look like.

### Verification (Optional)
If you want to check to verify that ACCP is properly working on your system, you can do any of the following:
1. Verify that the highest priority provider actually is ACCP:
```java
if (Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding").getProvider().getName().equals(AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.PROVIDER_NAME)) {
    // Successfully installed
}
```
2. Ask ACCP about its health
```java
if (AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.INSTANCE.getLoadingError() == null && AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.INSTANCE.runSelfTests().equals(SelfTestStatus.PASSED)) {
    // Successfully installed
}
```
3. Assert that ACCP is healthy and throw a `RuntimeCryptoException` if it isn't.
We generally do not recommend this solution as we believe that gracefully falling back to other providers is usually the better option.
```java
AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.INSTANCE.assertHealthy();
```

### Other system properties
ACCP can be configured via several system properties.
None of these should be needed for standard deployments and we recommend not touching them.
They are of most use to developers needing to test ACCP or experiment with benchmarking.
These are all read early in the load process and may be cached so any changes to them made from within Java may not be respected.
Thus, these should all be set on the JVM command line using `-D`.

* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.extrachecks`
   Adds exta cryptographic consistency checks which are not necessary on standard systems.
   These checks may be computationally expensive and are not normally relevant.
   See `ExtraCheck.java` for values and more information.
   (Also accepts "ALL" as a value to enable all flags and "help" to print out all flags to STDERR.)
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.debug`
   Enables extra debugging behavior.
   These behaviors may be computationally expensive, produce additional output, or otherwise change the behavior of ACCP.
   No values here will lower the security of ACCP or cause it to give incorrect results.
   See `DebugFlag.java` for values and more information.
   (Also accepts "ALL" as a value to enable all flags and "help" to print out all flags to STDERR.)
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.useExternalLib`
   Takes in `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`).
   If `true` then ACCP skips trying to load the native library bundled within its JAR and goes directly to the system library path.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.janitor.stripes`
   Takes *positive integer value* which is the requested minimum number of "stripes" used by the `Janitor` for dividing cleaning tasks (messes) among its workers.
   (Current behavior is to default this value to 4 times the CPU core count and then round the value up to the nearest power of two.)
   See `Janitor.java` for for more information.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.cacheselftestresults` Takes in `true` or `false`
  (defaults to `true`). If set to `true`, the results of running tests are cached,
  and the subsequent calls to `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider::runSelfTests`
  would avoid re-running tests; otherwise, each call to `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider::runSelfTests`
  re-run the tests.
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.registerEcParams`
  Takes in `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`).
  If `true`, then ACCP will register its EC-flavoered AlgorithmParameters implementation on startup.
  Else, the JCA will get the implementation from another registered provider (usually stock JCE).
  Using JCE's impelmentation is generally recommended unless using ACCP as a standalone provider
  Callers can choose to register ACCP's implementation at runtime with a call to `AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.registerEcParams()`
* `com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.registerSecureRandom`
  Takes in `true` or `false` (defaults to `false` in FIPS mode, defaults to `true` in non-FIPS).
  If `true`, then ACCP will register a SecureRandom implementation (`LibCryptoRng`) backed by AWS-LC
  Else, ACCP will not register a SecureRandom implementation, meaning that the JCA will source SecureRandom instances from another registered provider. AWS-LC will still use its internal DRBG for key generation and other operations requiring secure pseudo-randomness.
  LibCryptoRng is very fast during steady state operation in all cases. In FIPS mode, however, AWS-LC-FIPS's CPU jitter-based entropy source incurs a ~10ms initialization cost for every new thread.
  This means that there is a slight "pause" before ACCP FIPS's SecureRandom can produce pseudo-random bytes in highly threaded environments.
  Because, in extreme cases this could present an availability risk, we do not register LibCryptoRng by default in configurations where this initialization cost is incurred (i.e. FIPS mode).
  Non-FIPS AWS-LC does not use CPU jitter for its DRBG seed's entropy, and therefore does not incur this initialization cost, therefore we register LibCryptoRng by default when not in FIPS mode.
